# OCF lite - Data Collection Form

This repository contains a web-based form designed for organizations to collect and store data related to the consumption of various emission sources. The data collected through this form can be used to calculate an organization's carbon footprint.

This site was built using GitHub Pages and can be accessed using this link: [Visit The OCF lite Site](https://adinzlotyint.github.io/OCF-lite/).

## Features

Due to the imposed project requirement of not using servers or cloud providers, all data is stored and processed locally in the user's browser. This approach simplifies deployment and ensures full control over the data without concerns over external storage or data breaches.
Users can share their data on their own using external tools such as FTP, e-mail, etc.

## Purpose

The presented page is part of a larger application project that will allow for the aggregation of data collected through this form, its transformation, and ultimately the visualization and presentation of carbon footprint results.

One of the features will also include the ability to create a custom file that would allow users to modify the contents of dropdown lists in the form. This way, if an organization encounters an emission source that was not predefined, the administrator within the organization can share this new configuration file, enabling the form to be tailored to specific needs.
