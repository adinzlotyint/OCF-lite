                This feature allows users to input and manage their own specific
                emission sources related to their organization. Once the custom
                data is imported, it will be available in a drop-down menu for
                easy selection of the desired emission source. The custom list
                file can be generated using the OCF Lite Tool, which is
                currently under development. Please note that if the uploaded
                file does not adhere to the required format, an error message
                will be shown, prompting the user to correct the issue.
                Additionally, custom lists are session-specific and will not be
                saved or carried over between sessions. This ensures that each
                session starts with a clean slate, requiring the user to
                re-upload their custom lists if needed.

                This feature allows users to reload data they have previously
                created and downloaded. Users can upload a JSON file,
                specifically generated by the app, which contains their custom
                data entries. This data is then reloaded into the application's
                tables, enabling users to continue working with their existing
                data without having to re-enter it. <br />
                <br />
                To use this feature, users should first create and manage their
                data within the app's table interface. Once satisfied, they can
                download their data in a JSON format directly from the app. This
                file can later be re-imported using the "Import Previous Data"
                option, ensuring that all previously saved data is restored and
                available for further editing or analysis. <br />
                <br />
                The app automatically validates the structure of the uploaded
                JSON file, ensuring compatibility. If the file is not in the
                correct format or contains errors, the system will alert the
                user with an appropriate error message, prompting them to upload
                a correct file. <br />
                <br />
                This feature is designed for session continuity and data
                recovery. When you load the data, it will persist across
                sessions by being stored in your browser's local storage. This
                means that if you make changes to the data, those changes will
                be saved automatically and remain available when you return to
                the app. However, these changes will only be stored locally and
                will not update the original JSON file. If you wish to retain
                the changes permanently, you must download the updated table
                with the new data. <br />
                <br />
                This functionality is ideal for users who need to pause and
                resume their work, providing a seamless way to manage and reload
                their custom data within the app. The local storage feature
                ensures that your data remains intact between sessions, allowing
                you to continue working seamlessly. <br /> <br />
                However, to fully leverage this data, especially for calculating
                your carbon footprint, as well as related analyses,
                visualizations, and reporting, you will need to use the OCF Lite
                Tool, which is specifically designed to process this JSON file.
                Remember to download your data if you need to create a backup or
                share it with your organizationâ€™s administrator, who holds the
                OCF Lite Tool license. <br /> <br />

                The Optional Data Section is designed to help users of the OCF
                Lite Tool easily identify the origin of the data and streamline
                data aggregation processes within the tool. This section allows
                users to input additional details such as the country of origin,
                the company's name, the user's full name, and their job email
                address. By providing this optional information, users can
                ensure that their data is more organized and traceable,
                facilitating more efficient processing and analysis when the
                data is imported into the OCF Lite Tool. The details entered in
                this section are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing
                them to persist across sessions. This means that the information
                will be automatically populated the next time the user accesses
                the app, reducing the need to re-enter the same data repeatedly.
